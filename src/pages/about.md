## Who I am

Hello! I'm Matthew Tao, an aspiring front-end developer who's currently studying Computer Science at the University of Auckland.

My first encounter with code was at the age of thirteen, where I signed up for a coding club at my school. We were taught the fundamentals of programming with a programming language called Scratch.

I liked the idea of creating something completely original, being able to translate an idea into something more concrete and started to code in my free time as a hobby. This is when I wrote (more like drag and dropped) the **_worst_** code in my life.

I drew a lot as a kid because I loved art and design. I clearly remember this three month period where I was absolutely obsessed with designing logos, and watched hours and hours of YouTube videos covering them.

I think my love for web development has been a natural follow on from these two interests. I get to bash my head against a problem until it gives while trying to make designs that look good.
