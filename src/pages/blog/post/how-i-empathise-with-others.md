> live happily! - Subarashiki Hibi

(yes i type all lowercase! its my blog i get to decide the rules >:) )\
i find the idea that everyone's trying their best enables me to feel empathy for others. if someone is an asshole, chances are that there's something they're not happy with in their life. most of the time they're not even aware of this. \
i've recently been watching a lot of [Daniel Mackler](https://www.youtube.com/@dmackler58 "daniel mackler (external link)"), who was a therapist for over 10 years. his ideas about therapy are (at least in his opinion) not widely accepted. i would describe them as deeply empathetic. what he says is a huge portion of people diagnosed with mental illnesses are not really ill. that most of it stems deeply from buried childhood trauma. even if that is not the case, i'm certain many of his patients were able to get over their condition because of his ethos. it strikes me as similar to the presumption of innocence, better known as the phrase "innocent until proven guilty." a [legal fiction](https://legalvidhiya.com/the-concept-of-legal-fiction/ "the concept of legal fiction (external link)") that is plainly untrue, however serves as a useful guideline in the court.\
the idea that every mental condition is able to be recovered from may not be true. he may be wrong. however the principle that everything is treatable stops the therapist from labelling someone with a diagnosis, claiming they're untreatable, and moving to the next person. it encourages the forming of a deep and comprehensive understanding of how their patient came to be, and i believe, leads to a higher chance of recovery. on the patient's side, it's so much nicer to not be simply labelled, categorised and told you cannot recover. i'm certain there's been a lot of people who've been through it and simply did not have the hope to try improve as "it's just how they are".\
all this to say that i believe that people are inherently good. every "truly bad person" can be traced back to injustices enacted on *them, *likely when they were a kid. despite the past, i'd like to think we can all ultimately become better people :)
