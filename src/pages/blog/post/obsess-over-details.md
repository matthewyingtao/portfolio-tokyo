title: Obsess over Details / Lack of Care

  A reflection on AI, carelessness, and why “good enough” isn’t. On craft,
  detail, and the quiet erosion of taste in a world too quick to accept slop.

The loss of craft is what I expect the biggest impact of AI will be over the next few years. When AI is used by the 99% of people who simply clock into work without care for their craft, the world will get blander and more average.

Why do I say this? Well, think about what happens in a typical AI workflow. In the case of AI image generation, you ask for a “Close up shot of a turtle on top of a stack of money, eyes closed, cartoon style” and you get… a mathematical approximation of what you were asking for. In other words, you get an image that’s “good enough”.

In this case, there are a couple more angles to think about.

Firstly, the image you’re asking for may be genuinely in bad taste. A “turtle on top of a stack of money” sounds incredibly tacky, but I’ve seen people use similar images for their social media posts. For someone who doesn’t care about what they’re posting, whether it’s personal or work related, they just want _an_ image, whatever fits the vibe they’re going for. If it’s for marriage, then an image that evokes holy, purity vibes. For a beach party, the invite should have a fun, rad looking illustration.

Secondly, why is the art often so incredibly bland? After a lot of thinking, I feel that I’ve finally come to an answer that I’m happy with. The answer is in the details. Whenever AI is used to create work, <small>_(Image generation, write an essay, write an entire computer program, etc)_</small> rather than aid human work, <small>_(e.g. spotting errors in writing, creating a topic structure for an essay to be written)_</small> it’s always in broad strokes. It’s incredibly frustrating for me to see so many people accept the AI work as “good enough” when it so often fails in the details.

People who spend a lot of time dealing with AI know that it’s not very difficult to recognise its writing or images. I think a large part of that is because none of the details make sense. An artist can only draw in their lens of the world. A writer can only write through their comprehension of life. These details of how sentences flow, how brush strokes combine, are what we appreciate as a good piece of art. I think the idea that “AI can only replicate the ability of artists” holds true in that it doesn’t have the same attention to detail as the human who cares.

Let’s look at a more isolated example.

## Lets say I wanted a button CTA button

Asking ChatGPT for one gives me this:

In the absence of more detail, it defaults to giving me the most button-looking-button.

If I was a small business owner [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) myself a shopfront website, I would probably lack the attention to detail to consider things like hover & active animations, accessibility and SEO faults that might need to be checked. AI won’t do these things without being asked explicitly. You would need someone to be knowledgeable about these topics, and to _know_ what to ask for.

A programmer-designer could look at the button and tweak it so that [everything feels “just right”](https://stephango.com/in-good-hands). This is primarily why I believe that at least for a long time, AI won’t replace **people who care**.

> "Delicacy of taste is as much to be desired and cultivated as delicacy of passion is to be lamented, and to be remedied, if possible. The good or ill accidents of life are very little at our disposal; but we are pretty much masters what books we shall read, what diversions we shall partake of, and what company we shall keep…When a man is possessed of that talent, he is more happy by what pleases his taste, than by what gratifies his appetites, and receives more enjoyment from a poem or a piece of reasoning than the most expensive luxury can afford."

## Figma Sites is the result of a lack of care

We can see the effects of this in the recent launch of [Figma Sites](https://www.figma.com/sites/). Kevin Powell’s video, “[Figma Sites Is Worse Than You Might Have Thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsFIvULxkHI)” covers the flaws in the product. These sites are somewhat nonsense from a code standpoint, with a lack of structure, misuse of `<divs>` as buttons, and no heading tags. What does this mean to a non-programmer? For one, it means that the website will likely be penalised on Google’s search ranking for not being easily read. It also means that anyone who uses a screen reader (i.e. the blind or visually impaired) might struggle to navigate and read the content.

These mistakes are really basic stuff. Maybe there was a time crunch, and they _really_ couldn’t avoid shipping the product in such a broken state, but it’s hard for me to believe that there were people in control of Figma Sites who cared about the code output.

## So then, what shall we do?

AI can’t replace the detail-work you do. Asking it to write an essay about Tang Dynasty ideals will only produce an average essay. If you want to make something amazing, then you have to give a damn, about each and every bit of the process, how each detail lines up, how other people will receive each piece. An average person with average tastes, who produces slop will only get so far without developing their ability to sense what’s wrong.
