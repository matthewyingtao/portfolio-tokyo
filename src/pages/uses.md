## Uses

Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)' [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/), here is a list of things I use on a daily basis that help me code.

## Software and Tools

* I use **Visual Studio Code** as my code editor of choice with the [Rose Pine Moon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mvllow.rose-pine "rose pine moon for vscode (external link)") theme and the [Fluent Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.fluent-icons) extension. The font I use is Roboto Mono. Here's what that looks like:

* I use **Figma** to prototype and iterate my website and app designs, as well as to create simple SVG files (I use **Adobe Illustrator** for anything more complex).
* **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)** is an amazing web app I often use to compress images.

### List of useful VS Code extensions

* [File Nesting Updater](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.file-nesting "File Nesting Updater for vs code (external link)") - Automatically updates the file-nesting for a bunch of related files. Incredibly useful for front-end projects, particularly since they always have a bunch of config files. (ts, prettier, lock files, etc.)
* [HTML Biscuits](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeBiscuits.html-biscuits) - Adds a class list to the end of HTML elements, helps identify which closing-tag you're looking at.
* [Pretty TypeScript Errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors) - Does what it says on the box.
* [Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode) - Tightens the feedback loop for JS and TS script development IMMENSELY. Cannot recommend enough if you're picking up programming for the first time, and trying to learn JS.
